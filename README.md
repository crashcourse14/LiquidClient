# LiquidClient v1

Liquid Client is an Eaglercraft 1.5.2 client. It includes a custom loading screen (inspiration from Resent 5.0), main menu, and mod menu. Also, for any server that supports 1.5.2 will get their own background image.

## Extra
The client is still in its first version, and bugs and game crashes will be common (although we have not seen any yet). 
We still need to work on:

- Module Customization (Especially the text supported)
- Better mod menu, with scrollable panels
